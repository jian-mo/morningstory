# What's the Glory, Morning Story? ðŸ¤–

## Tired of the Pre-Standup Scramble? We're Building a Solution!

This is an open-source **Morning Story** designed to help you and your team automate the preparation for daily standup meetings. Spend less time digging through tasks and commits, and more time focusing on your work!

We're **building this project in public**, sharing our progress, challenges, and learnings along the way. Follow our journey!

## The Problem

Do you often find yourself:
*   Forgetting what you accomplished yesterday?
*   Scrambling through multiple platforms (GitHub, Jira, Asana, Slack, etc.) just minutes before your standup?
*   Delivering incomplete or rushed updates?

This bot aims to solve that!

## What We're Building (Core Features - Planned)

*   **Smart Integrations:** Connects to your favorite Project Management tools (Asana, Jira, Trello, etc.) and Git hosting services (GitHub, GitLab).
*   **Activity Aggregation:** Automatically fetches your relevant activity â€“ completed tasks, in-progress items, commits, pull requests, and blockers.
*   **LLM-Powered Summaries:** Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently synthesize your activity into a concise draft for your standup, covering:
    *   What you did yesterday.
    *   What you plan to do today.
    *   Any blockers you're facing.
*   **Customizable Output:** Tailor the tone and format of your standup notes.
*   **Multiple Interfaces:** Access through a CLI, a web interface, and potentially chat bots (Slack, Teams).

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** TypeScript with NestJS (enterprise-grade, modular architecture)
*   **Database:** AWS RDS PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
*   **Cache/Jobs:** AWS ElastiCache Redis
*   **Frontend (Web):** React 18 with TypeScript (coming soon)
*   **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent standup generation
*   **Authentication:** JWT with GitHub OAuth integration
*   **Deployment:** AWS ECS (API) + Vercel (Frontend)
*   **Infrastructure:** Docker containers, GitHub Actions CI/CD
*   **Monorepo:** Turbo for efficient builds and testing
